What is Class Imbalance?
-->A scenario wherein the distribution of samples per class in the available dataset is not equal (or nearly equal in percentage).
In other words, all classes are not equally represented in the dataset.

Why do we need to handle class Imbalance?
-->Most machine learning algorithms assume data equally distributed. So when we have a class imbalance, the machine learning classifier tends to be more biased towards the majority class, causing bad classification of the minority class.

Different Techniques to handle class imbalance:
1.RResample the training set-Random undersampling,Random oversampling.
2.SMOTE
